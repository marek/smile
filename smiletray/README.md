## About:
This tool was created back in 2005 to capture screen shots in 
Counter-Strike: Source. It scans logs and takes a screenshot when a kill is
deteced. It keeps track of various in-game statistics and supports a variety
of games.  

It can be used as a regular screen capture utility with the built-in hotkey
support that allows you to capture an active window or your entire desktop.

## Installation:
Extract Smile! to a folder of your choice. You should just have this 
readme.txt, and smiletray.exe. In order to get Smile! working you need 
to at least configure your game to enable logs, and to enter paths for 
the specific games within Smile!'s options. Since paths include 
different games and their mods it may be confusing, so please refer to 
the "Game Paths" section of this Readme.txt for further details on what 
you should enter.
